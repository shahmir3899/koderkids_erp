Mastering Pixel Art with
Pixilart
Welcome to Pixel Art Magic!
Get ready to create awesome digital art!
In Book 1, you learned simple drawing using paint.
Now, you’ll learn how to make amazing pictures and even animations using
tiny colored squares called pixels. We’ll use a cool website called Pixilart to
make your art shine.
Let’s get started!
What is Pixel Art?
It’s a special kind of digital drawing where you use tiny squares of color.

Why Learn Pixel Art?
You can make fun characters, cool scenes, and even
animations, just like in your favorite video games
Chapter Preview:
You’ll draw with pixels, make art move, create scenes, and tell a story with your pixel art.

Instructions:
Ask an adult to open www.pixilart.com in a web browser on your computer.

1.1 Understanding Pixel Art Basics
Great pixel art looks neat and clear! You’ll learn about pixels (the tiny squares!), choose
your drawing size, and pick colors to make your art pop, just like the bold designs on a
Pakistani truck art painting. Understanding these basics helps people understand your pixel
art ideas
Why Focus on Pixel Basics?
It makes your art interesting and easy to see.

Key Tip
Start with a small drawing area.
Choose bright, clear colors.
Every tiny square matters!

Fun Fact:
Many classic video games, like Super
Mario were made with pixel art!

Class Activity Preview:
You’ll create your first pixel drawing next.

1.2 Making Pixel Art Move: Simple Animations
Animations make your pixel art come alive, like a dancing kite! In Pixilart, you create a
series of drawings called frames, each slightly different. When you play them fast, it
looks like movement! These tricks make your pixel art fun, like coding animations in
Scratch (Chapter 3).

What’s Frame?
It’s one single picture in a sequence
that makes up an animation.

What’s Animation in Pixilart?
Drawing a little bit differently on
each frame to show something
moving or changing.

Class Activity Preview:
You’ll animate your pixel art next.

Parent Tip:
Watch your child’s pixel animations and cheer them on!

Teaching AI with Google
Teachable Machine
Welcome to AI Magic!
Get ready to meet Artificial Intelligence (AI)!
In Book 1, you learned how to code simple games. Now, you’ll learn how to teach
computers to be smart using a tool called Google Teachable Machine.
You’ll teach machine to recognize things, sounds, or even your movements, just like a
smart robot!

What is AI?

It’s like making computers smart so they can learn and do amazing things, like
recognize faces or understand your voice..

Why Learn AI?

Create exciting projects, like a festival story!

Chapter Preview:
You’ll collect examples, train AI, try different types of AI, and plan your own AI
project
Instructions:
Ask an adult to open Google Teachable Machine in a web browser on your
computer. (Search for "Google Teachable Machine").`
21
2.1 Understanding How AI "Learns"
Great AI models learn from good examples! Imagine teaching a new trick to a pet – you show
them what to do clearly. AI works similarly: you give it many examples so it can learn patterns.
We call these examples "data." The better your examples, the smarter your AI will be, like
preparing all the right ingredients for a delicious Pakistani dish! Good examples help AI
understand your ideas.
Great slides look neat and professional! You’ll customize layouts, add colors, and choose fonts
to make your slides pop, like a poster for a festival. Good design helps people understand your
ideas.

Why Focus on Examples?

Making Computers Work
Together with n8n
Welcome to Automation Magic!
Get ready to make computers do amazing things for you! In Book 1, you
learned simple coding. Now, you’ll learn how to teach different computer
programs (like your email app, or a game app) to talk to each other and
do tasks automatically! We’ll explore an idea called "automation" using a tool
called n8n (say "n-eight-n"). It's like building smart chains for your
computer, just like connecting different parts of a train! Let’s get
started!

What is Automation?
It’s when computers do tasks by themselves, following rules you
set, so you don’t have to do them every time.

Why Learn Automation?
You can create exciting projects, like having your computer
send you a message when your favorite show starts!

Chapter Preview:
You’ll learn about starting points (triggers), what happens next (actions), connecting
different computer tools, and planning your own automation.

Instructions:
Ask an adult to help you visit www.n8n.io to see what the n8n website looks like and
explore its visual workflow builder. This chapter focuses on understanding how
automation works, so you won't need to sign up for an account or install anything for
now – we're learning the ideas behind it!

160
11.1 Understanding "Triggers" and "Actions"
Every automatic task starts with something happening, and then something else happens!
Imagine a domino effect: one domino falls (Trigger), and it makes another domino fall
(Action). In computers, a Trigger is the event that starts an automation, and an Action is
what the computer does because of that trigger. Good planning of triggers and actions
helps your automation work perfectly, just like planning all the steps for cooking a
delicious biryani!

Why Focus on Triggers & Actions?
They are the two main parts of every automation chain.

Key Tip
An automation always starts with a Trigger (the "if this..." part).
An Action is what you want the computer to do (the "...then that" part).

Fun Fact:
When you get an email, your phone
showing a notification is an automation
(email arriving is the trigger, notification is
the action)!

Class Activity Preview:
You’ll identify triggers and actions in simple stories next.

161
Class Activity 1: Identify Triggers and Actions
1.Read the Story: Your teacher or an adult will read a short story or describe a situation.
2.Find the Trigger: Listen carefully for what starts the event. What is the "if this..."?
3.Find the Action: Listen for what happens next because of the trigger. What is the "...then
that" or "...then this happens"?

1
Step
2
Step
Example Stories:
1.Story 1: "When the call to prayer (Azan) sounds, my family gets ready for prayer."
2.Trigger: __________________________________
3.Action: ___________________________________
4.Story 2: "If the Eid moon is sighted, then we know Eid is tomorrow and everyone starts
planning celebrations!"
5.Trigger: __________________________________
6.Action 1: ___________________________________
7.Action 2: ___________________________________
8.Story 3: "When my favorite cartoon starts on TV, then my tablet gives a little 'ding!' noise."
9.Trigger: __________________________________
10.Action: ___________________________________
Challenge:
Think of your own simple everyday event. What
is the trigger and what is the action?

Home Activity 1:
With a parent, find one trigger and action pair in your home routine (e.g., "When the
alarm rings, I wake up," or "When the doorbell rings, the dog barks").

162
11.2 Building Simple Computer Chains (Workflows)
Just like you can link many dominoes to create a long chain, you can link many triggers
and actions to create a workflow! A workflow is a series of steps where one
computer task leads to another. These chains make your computer do many things
automatically, one after the other
What’s a Chain/Workflow?
It’s a series of connected steps that make
computers do multiple tasks automatically,
like a path from start to finish.

How to Build a Chain?
You start with a trigger, then connect it to an
action, and that action can lead to another
action, and so on!

Class Activity Preview:
You’ll draw your first computer workflow chain next
Parent Tip:
Discuss real-life "chains" with your child (e.g., "If I put my dirty clothes in the basket,
then the washing machine washes them, then they get dried, then I fold them").

163
Class Activity 2 - Draw Your First Computer Chain
Let’s design a simple computer chain (workflow)! You’ll draw out the steps for a
computer to follow for a fun task.

Draw the First Action: Draw
another box or circle. Inside, write:
"Action 1: Find Game Link" (Draw a
small magnifying glass icon!).

third box or circle. Inside, write:
"Action 2: Send Message to Tablet"
(Draw a small message bubble icon!).

Step
Step
Connect Them! Draw arrows from the
"Trigger" box to "Action 1," and from "Action
1" to "Action 2." This shows the chain!

Challenge:
Add a new action to your chain: "If
the game is a new update, also send
a message to my friend!" (This
introduces a simple "if/then" idea).

Home Activity 2
Draw a simple chain (workflow) for how your favorite app works from
when you open it to when it does something cool (e.g., "When I open YouTube, it
loads my profile, then it shows new videos").

165
11.3 Connecting Different Computer "Tools" (Apps)
Automation is super powerful because it can make many different computer programs,
or "apps," work together! n8n helps these different "tools" share information and tasks,
just like different instruments playing together in an orchestra. You can connect your
email app to a messaging app, or a weather app to a calendar app! You’ll try to imagine
connecting these tools next!

Why Connect Tools?
To make different computer programs work as a
team, so you don't have to copy-paste information
or jump between apps!

Example:
Connect an online photo album to a friend's
sharing app.

Class Activity Preview:
You’ll imagine connecting different apps.

DIY Idea:
Think about two apps you use often. What would happen if they could talk to each other? What
new cool thing could they do?

166
Class Activity 3 - Imagine Connecting Your Favorite Apps
Let’s be super creative and imagine connecting our favorite computer apps to do
something new!

Challenge:
Add a decision step: "If it's raining, then send
message: 'Let's play indoor games!'" (This is like an
"if/then" rule within your workflow).

168
11.4 Planning a 5-Step Computer Automation Project
Now combine all your new knowledge to plan your very own computer automation! You’ll
create a simple 5-step plan for an automation project, like writing down all the ingredients and
steps before you bake a cake. This is like outlining a story on Google Drive (Chapter 7).

What’s an Automation Project?
It’s an idea for how to use triggers, actions, and connected apps
to make a computer do a helpful task automatically.

Example:
An automation that tells you when your favorite game has a new
update, or when a friend posts a new drawing online.

Class Activity Preview:
You’ll plan your own 5-step automation idea next.

Parent Tip:
Discuss simple ways automation could help in your family's daily life!
