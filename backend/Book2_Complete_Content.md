## Chapter 1: Mastering Pixel Art with Pixilart

**Welcome to Pixel Art Magic!**

Get ready to create awesome digital art!

In Book 1, you learned simple drawing using paint. Now, you'll learn how to make amazing pictures and even animations using tiny colored squares called pixels. We'll use a cool website called Pixilart to make your art shine.

Let's get started!

**What is Pixel Art?**

It's a special kind of digital drawing where you use tiny squares of color.

**Why Learn Pixel Art?**

You can make fun characters, cool scenes, and even animations, just like in your favorite video games!

**Chapter Preview:**

You'll draw with pixels, make art move, create scenes, and tell a story with your pixel art.

**Instructions:**

Ask an adult to open www.pixilart.com in a web browser on your computer.

### 1.1 Understanding Pixel Art Basics

Great pixel art looks neat and clear! You'll learn about pixels (the tiny squares!), choose your drawing size, and pick colors to make your art pop, just like the bold designs on a Pakistani truck art painting. Understanding these basics helps people understand your pixel art ideas.

**Why Focus on Pixel Basics?**

It makes your art interesting and easy to see.

**Key Tips:**

- Start with a small drawing area

- Choose bright, clear colors

- Every tiny square matters!

**Fun Fact:** Many classic video games, like Super Mario were made with pixel art!

**Class Activity Preview:**

You'll create your first pixel drawing next.

#### Class Activity 1: Draw a Pixel Festival Icon

Let's make a tiny pixel drawing for a Pakistani festival! You'll choose a small drawing area and use colors to create a simple pixel icon.

**Step 1: Open Pixilart**
Go to www.pixilart.com and click "Start Drawing" at the top of the page.

**Step 2: Start a New Drawing**
On the pop-up, choose a small size like 64x64 pixels (or a similar small size if 64x64 isn't a direct option, e.g., 50x50 or 32x32), then click "New Drawing."

**Step 3: Find Your Tools**
Look for the Pencil tool on the left side. Choose a color from the right side (the color palette) similar to Paint.

**Step 4: Draw Your Icon**
Carefully click tiny squares to draw a simple picture of a kite. Remember, it's pixel art, so it will look blocky!

**Step 5: Color it In**
Select the Paint Bucket tool (it looks like a spilling bucket) and click inside your kite drawing to fill it with color.

**Step 6: Save**
Click the "File" menu (usually at the top left, a small floppy disk icon or similar) and select "Save As .pixil". Name it "MyKite.pixil" and save it to your computer.

**Challenge:** Change the color of your kite, or add a tiny string to it.

#### Home Activity 1

Design a pixel art icon for your favorite food (e.g., a small pixel biryani plate, a pixel samosa) with custom colors.

### 1.2 Making Pixel Art Move: Simple Animations

Animations make your pixel art come alive, like a dancing kite! In Pixilart, you create a series of drawings called frames, each slightly different. When you play them fast, it looks like movement! These tricks make your pixel art fun, like coding animations in Scratch (Chapter 3).

**What's a Frame?**

It's one single picture in a sequence that makes up an animation.

**What's Animation in Pixilart?**

Drawing a little bit differently on each frame to show something moving or changing.

**Class Activity Preview:**

You'll animate your pixel art next.

**Parent Tip:** Watch your child's pixel animations and cheer them on!

#### Class Activity 2: Animate Your Pixel Icon

Let's make your pixel kite dance! You'll add frames and make small changes to create a simple animation, building on your festival icon.

**Step 1: Open Your Project**
Go to www.pixilart.com. Click "File" > "Open .pixil" and open your "MyKite.pixil" file.

**Step 2: Find Frames**
Go to the GIF Frames file at bottom of the screen.

**Step 3: Duplicate Frames**
You'll see "Frame 1." Click the "+" button or "Duplicate Frame" icon to add "Frame 2" that looks exactly like Frame 1. Do this a few times until you have 3 or 4 frames.

**Step 4: Make Changes**
Click on Frame 2. Use the Pencil tool or Eraser to make a tiny change to your kite (e.g., make the string wiggle a little, or change a color slightly). Click on Frame 3. Make another tiny change.

**Step 5: Play Animation**
Click the "Preview" button to see your kite move!

**Step 6: Adjust Speed**
If it's too fast or too slow, change the "FPS" (Frames Per Second) number bottom of the frame. A smaller number (like 100ms) makes it slower.

**Step 7: Save as GIF**
Click the "File" menu again, then "Export". Choose "Animated GIF" and click "Download." Name it "AnimatedKite.gif" and save it.

**Challenge:** Make your kite animation loop smoothly by making the last frame almost match the first frame.

#### Home Activity 2

Copy a paint drawing file to a new folder called "My Art."

### 1.3 Building Pixel Scenes and Characters

Keyboard shortcuts make organizing faster, like a magic trick! Instead of right-clicking, use keys to cut, copy, or undo, speeding up your work like in PowerPoint (Chapter 1).

**Why Build Scenes/Characters?**

It makes your pixel art lively and fun, like designing your own game world!

**Example:**

You can draw a pixelated version of your school, or a tiny pixel robot exploring a city.

**Class Activity Preview:**

You'll draw a small pixel scene or character next.

**DIY Idea:** Draw a pixelated version of your own house or favorite street of village.

#### Class Activity 3: Create a Pixel Scene

**Step 5: Use Different Colors**
Experiment with different colors from the palette to make your scene vibrant.

**Step 6: Save**
Click "File" > "Save As .pixil" and name it "MyPixelScene.pixil."

**Challenge:** Can you add your animated pixel kite from Activity 2 into this scene? (You might need to copy and paste parts of your kite or redraw it here!)

### 1.4 Designing a 5-Frame Pixel Story

Now combine all your amazing pixel art skills to tell a short story! You'll create 5 different pixel art pictures, like a mini-comic book or storybook, using your designs and maybe even little animations. This is like planning a whole story.

**What's a Pixel Story?**

It's a series of pixel art drawings that tell a simple tale or show a sequence of events.

**Example:**

A story about a pixel character meeting a friend, or a day at a pixel festival!

**Class Activity Preview:**

You'll build a 5-panel pixel story next.

**Parent Tip:** Tell a pixel story with your child at home!

## Chapter 11: Making Computers Work Together with n8n

**Welcome to Automation Magic!**

Get ready to make computers do amazing things for you! In Book 1, you learned simple coding. Now, you'll learn how to teach different computer programs (like your email app, or a game app) to talk to each other and do tasks automatically! We'll explore an idea called "automation" using a tool called n8n (say "n-eight-n"). It's like building smart chains for your computer, just like connecting different parts of a train! Let's get started!

**What is Automation?**

It's when computers do tasks by themselves, following rules you set, so you don't have to do them every time.

**Why Learn Automation?**

You can create exciting projects, like having your computer send you a message when your favorite show starts!

**Chapter Preview:**

You'll learn about starting points (triggers), what happens next (actions), connecting different computer tools, and planning your own automation.

**Instructions:**

Ask an adult to help you visit www.n8n.io to see what the n8n website looks like and explore its visual workflow builder. This chapter focuses on understanding how automation works, so you won't need to sign up for an account or install anything for now - we're learning the ideas behind it!

### 11.1 Understanding "Triggers" and "Actions"

Every automatic task starts with something happening, and then something else happens! Imagine a domino effect: one domino falls (Trigger), and it makes another domino fall (Action). In computers, a Trigger is the event that starts an automation, and an Action is what the computer does because of that trigger. Good planning of triggers and actions helps your automation work perfectly, just like planning all the steps for cooking a delicious biryani!

**Why Focus on Triggers & Actions?**

They are the two main parts of every automation chain.

**Key Tip:**

- An automation always starts with a Trigger (the "if this..." part).

- An Action is what you want the computer to do (the "...then that" part).

**Fun Fact:** When you get an email, your phone showing a notification is an automation (email arriving is the trigger, notification is the action)!

**Class Activity Preview:**

You'll identify triggers and actions in simple stories next.

#### Class Activity 1: Identify Triggers and Actions

Let's find triggers and actions in everyday stories! Your teacher will read stories and you'll identify what starts the action.

**Step 1: Read the Story**
Your teacher or an adult will read a short story or describe a situation.

**Step 2: Find the Trigger**
Listen carefully for what starts the event. What is the "if this..."?

**Step 3: Find the Action**
Listen for what happens next because of the trigger. What is the "...then that" or "...then this happens"?

**Challenge:** Think of your own simple everyday event. What is the trigger and what is the action?

#### Home Activity 1

With a parent, find one trigger and action pair in your home routine (e.g., "When the alarm rings, I wake up," or "When the doorbell rings, the dog barks").

### 11.2 Building Simple Computer Chains (Workflows)

Just like you can link many dominoes to create a long chain, you can link many triggers and actions to create a workflow! A workflow is a series of steps where one computer task leads to another. These chains make your computer do many things automatically, one after the other.

**What's a Chain/Workflow?**

It's a series of connected steps that make computers do multiple tasks automatically, like a path from start to finish.

**How to Build a Chain?**

You start with a trigger, then connect it to an action, and that action can lead to another action, and so on!

**Class Activity Preview:**

You'll draw your first computer workflow chain next.

**Parent Tip:** Discuss real-life "chains" with your child (e.g., "If I put my dirty clothes in the basket, then the washing machine washes them, then they get dried, then I fold them").

#### Class Activity 2: Draw Your First Computer Chain

Let's design a simple computer chain (workflow)! You'll draw out the steps for a computer to follow for a fun task.

**Step 1: Get Ready**
Get a piece of paper and a pencil, or open a simple drawing app on your computer.

**Step 2: Choose a Goal**
We want to automate this: "When my favorite online video game is ready to play, send me a message on my tablet."

**Step 3: Draw the Trigger**
Draw a box or circle. Inside, write: "Trigger: Game Ready" (You can draw a small game controller icon!).

**Step 4: Draw the First Action**
Draw another box or circle. Inside, write: "Action 1: Find Game Link" (Draw a small magnifying glass icon!).

**Step 5: Draw the Second Action**
Draw a third box or circle. Inside, write: "Action 2: Send Message to Tablet" (Draw a small message bubble icon!).

**Step 6: Connect Them**
Draw arrows from the "Trigger" box to "Action 1," and from "Action 1" to "Action 2." This shows the chain!

**Challenge:** Add a new action to your chain: "If the game is a new update, also send a message to my friend!" (This introduces a simple "if/then" idea).

#### Home Activity 2

Draw a simple chain (workflow) for how your favorite app works from when you open it to when it does something cool (e.g., "When I open YouTube, it loads my profile, then it shows new videos").

### 11.3 Connecting Different Computer "Tools" (Apps)

Automation is super powerful because it can make many different computer programs, or "apps," work together! n8n helps these different "tools" share information and tasks, just like different instruments playing together in an orchestra. You can connect your email app to a messaging app, or a weather app to a calendar app! You'll try to imagine connecting these tools next!

**Why Connect Tools?**

To make different computer programs work as a team, so you don't have to copy-paste information or jump between apps!

**Example:**

Connect an online photo album to a friend's sharing app.

**Class Activity Preview:**

You'll imagine connecting different apps.

**DIY Idea:** Think about two apps you use often. What would happen if they could talk to each other? What new cool thing could they do?

#### Class Activity 3: Imagine Connecting Your Favorite Apps

Let's be super creative and imagine connecting our favorite computer apps to do something new!

**Step 1: Pick Your Apps**
Choose 2 or 3 of your favorite computer apps or online tools (e.g., a drawing app, a game, a music player, a video chat app, a calendar app).

**Step 2: Choose a Trigger App**
Decide which app will be the Trigger (the one that starts the automation).

**Step 3: Choose Action Apps**
Decide what other apps will do the Actions.

**Step 4: Draw Your Idea**
Draw each chosen app as a box. You can draw their logos inside! Draw arrows showing how you would want them to share information or trigger actions. Write a simple sentence explaining what your automation does!

**Challenge:** Add a decision step: "If it's raining, then send message: 'Let's play indoor games!'" (This is like an "if/then" rule within your workflow).

#### Home Activity 3: Make a Festival Folder

Create a pixel art picture about your family or a pixelated scene of your favorite family activity (e.g., a pixel picnic, a pixel game night, or a pixel picture of your family in traditional Pakistani clothes). Save it as a .pixil file or export it as a .png image.

### 11.4 Planning a 5-Step Computer Automation Project

Now combine all your new knowledge to plan your very own computer automation! You'll create a simple 5-step plan for an automation project, like writing down all the ingredients and steps before you bake a cake. This is like outlining a story on Google Drive (Chapter 7).

**What's an Automation Project?**

It's an idea for how to use triggers, actions, and connected apps to make a computer do a helpful task automatically.

**Example:**

An automation that tells you when your favorite game has a new update, or when a friend posts a new drawing online.

**Class Activity Preview:**

You'll plan your own 5-step automation idea next.

**Parent Tip:** Discuss simple ways automation could help in your family's daily life!

#### Class Activity 4: Plan Your Automation Invention

Let's create a 5-step plan for an amazing automation invention you can imagine! You'll use all your n8n-thinking skills to make it awesome.

**Step 1: The Goal**
What problem do you want your automation to solve, or what cool thing do you want it to do? Example: "I want to know immediately when my favorite online cartoon updates."

**Step 2: The Trigger**
What event will start your automation? Example: "The cartoon website updates."

**Step 3: The First Action**
What's the very first thing the computer does? Example: "The computer checks the cartoon website for new pictures."

**Step 4: The Second Action**
What else does the computer do after that? Example: "If there are new pictures, the computer sends a message to my parents' phone, saying 'New comic!'"

**Step 5: The Final Result**
What's the final cool thing that happens because of your automation? Example: "My parents tell me right away, and I get to read the new comic without even looking for it!"

**Challenge:** Add a "smart" decision to your plan. Example: "If it's past bedtime, don't send the message, just save the link for tomorrow!"

#### Home Activity 4

Share your automation idea with your family and explain how it would help make life easier!

#### Class Activity 3: Avoid Obstacles with Sensors

Let's make a smart robot! You'll use the Front Distance sensor from the Sensing category to measure how close obstacles are and help the robot turn to avoid them in the maze. The Front Distance sensor gives a number in millimeters (mm) that shows the distance, so you can set a rule like "turn if closer than 50mm."

**Step 1: Select Wall Maze**
Open vr.vex.com and select "Wall Maze" from the Playground options.

**Step 2: Add Forever Loop**
Drag a "forever" loop (from the Logic category) to the coding area to keep the robot moving continuously.

**Step 3: Add Small Movement**
Inside the loop, add "Drive Forward for 50mm" (from the Drivetrain category) so the robot advances in small steps to allow time for sensing.

**Step 4: Add Condition Block**
After the drive block, add an "if then" block (Logic category). On empty coding area: Drag the "Front Distance in mm" block (Sensing - Distance category). This is a round block that measures how far an object is. Drag the "<" comparison operator (from the Operators category under Logic - Math). This creates a diamond-shaped condition to check if the distance is less than a number.

**Step 5: Build the Condition**
Combine both blocks into one: Place "Front Distance in mm" on the left side of diamond, use the "<" operator in the middle, set the right side to "50" (see image). This checks if the obstacle is closer than 50mm.

**Step 6: Add Turn Action**
Drag your new combined condition block directly into the diamond slot of the "if then" block. Inside the "if then" block (from Logic), add "Turn Left for 90 degrees" (from the Drivetrain category) to make the robot change direction when an obstacle is closer than 50mm.

**Step 7: Test Your Code**
Run the code. Robot will now avoid walls. It will move to left when a Wall is detected at 50mm.

**Step 8: Experiment**
Change the distance from 50mm to 10mm, 20mm, 70mm and 100mm. What difference do you see.

### 9.3 Your First Arduino Program: Blinking LED

Let's make an LED blink! You'll write a simple program (called a "sketch" in Arduino) to turn a light on and off. It's like a Python loop (Chapter 5), but controls real hardware!

**What's a Sketch?**

A program for Arduino, written in the IDE.

**Key Functions:**

- setup(): Runs once at the start.

- loop(): Runs over and over forever.

**Activity Preview:**

You'll blink the built-in LED next.

**DIY Idea:** Try changing the blink speed!

#### Class Activity 3: Blink the Built-in LED

Let's write your first Arduino sketch to blink the built-in LED on your board!

**Step 1: Open Arduino IDE**
Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.

**Step 2: Open Blink Example**
Go to File > Examples > 01.Basics > Blink.

**Step 3: Read Code**
Read the code - it uses digitalWrite() to turn the LED on/off.

**Step 4: Upload Sketch**
Click the Upload button (right arrow) to send the code to Arduino.

**Step 5: Watch LED**
Watch the built-in LED (near pin 13) blink on and off!

**Step 6: Change Speed**
Change delay(1000) to delay(500) and upload again - it blinks faster!

**Challenge:** Make the LED blink in a pattern: fast, fast, slow!

#### Home Activity 3

Experiment with different delay values and record what happens.

### 9.4 Adding External Components

Now let's connect an external LED to your Arduino! You'll use a breadboard and wires to build a circuit. It's like building with LEGO, but for electronics!

A board with holes to connect wires and components without soldering.

**What You Need:**

- Arduino Uno

- Breadboard

- LED (any color)

- 220 ohm resistor

- Jumper wires

**Activity Preview:**

You'll build a circuit and blink an external LED.

**Safety Tip:** Always disconnect the USB before changing wires!

#### Class Activity 4: Blink an External LED

Let's build a circuit and blink an external LED! You'll connect components on a breadboard.

**Step 1: Disconnect USB**
Disconnect the USB cable from your Arduino.

**Step 2: Place LED**
Place the LED on the breadboard - long leg is positive (+).

**Step 3: Add Resistor**
Connect the resistor from the short leg of LED to the GND rail.

**Step 4: Connect Positive**
Connect a wire from the long leg of LED to pin 9 on Arduino.

**Step 5: Connect Ground**
Connect a wire from GND rail to GND on Arduino.

**Step 6: Modify Code**
